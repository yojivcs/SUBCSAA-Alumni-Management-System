## ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Purpose Notice

This project is primarily for educational purposes and demonstrates basic web development concepts. It has some known security limitations that make it unsuitable for production use without significant improvements:

1. **Basic Session Management:**
   - Simple PHP session handling without advanced security
   - No JWT or modern token-based authentication
   - Session fixation vulnerability may exist

2. **Limited Security Features:**
   - Basic password hashing without salt
   - No rate limiting on login attempts
   - No protection against SQL injection in some queries
   - Missing CSRF protection on forms
   - Basic file upload validation

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Passwords stored with basic hashing
   - No encryption for sensitive data
   - Limited input sanitization
   - Basic error handling

These limitations are intentionally left to keep the code simple and understandable for beginners. For production use, please implement proper security measures.
